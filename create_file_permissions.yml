#Here is an example Ansible playbook that creates a file, sets its permissions, and sets its owner:

---
- name: Create a file, set permissions and set owner
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  tasks:
  - name: Create file
    file:
      path: /path/to/file.txt
      state: touch
  - name: Set permissions
    file:
      path: /path/to/file.txt
      mode: 0664
  - name: Set owner
    file:
      path: /path/to/file.txt
      owner: user1
      group: user1

        #This playbook uses the file module to create the file, set its permissions, and set its owner. The path parameter specifies the location of the file, and the state parameter is set to touch to create a new, empty file if it doesn't already exist.

#The mode parameter is used to set the permissions on the file, and in this example, the permissions are set to 0664, which gives the owner and group read and write permissions, and other users read permissions.

#The owner and group parameters are used to set the owner and group of the file, and in this example, the owner and group are both set to user1.

#The become: yes directive is used to run the playbook with root privileges, which is necessary for setting the owner and group of the file.
