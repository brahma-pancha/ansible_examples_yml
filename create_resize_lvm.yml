#Here's an example of an Ansible playbook that creates a new Logical Volume Manager (LVM) on a Linux system:

- name: Create a new LVM
  hosts: <host group>
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Create a physical volume
      command: pvcreate /dev/<disk>
      args:
        creates: /dev/<disk>

    - name: Create a volume group
      command: vgcreate <volume group> /dev/<disk>

    - name: Create a logical volume
      command: lvcreate -L <size> -n <logical volume> <volume group>

    - name: Create a file system
      filesystem:
        fstype: <file system>
        dev: /dev/<volume group>/<logical volume>

    - name: Show LVM information
      command: lvs
      register: result

    - name: Display LVM information
      debug:
        var: result.stdout_lines

#Where:
#<host group> is the group of hosts you want to run the playbook on.
#<disk> is the name of the disk you want to use for the LVM (e.g., sda).
#<volume group> is the name of the volume group you want to create (e.g., vg0).
#<logical volume> is the name of the logical volume you want to create (e.g., lv0).
#<file system> is the type of file system you want to create on the logical volume (e.g., ext4).
#<size> is the size of the logical volume (e.g., 10G).
#This playbook will create a physical volume on the specified disk, create a volume group using the physical volume, create a logical volume with the specified size, and create a file system on the logical volume. The become directive allows the playbook to run with elevated privileges, as creating LVM typically requires administrator-level permissions. The creates directive for the pvcreate command ensures that the physical volume will only be created if it doesn't already exist. The playbook will also display information about the LVM using the lvs command.


#Here's an example of an Ansible playbook that extends an existing Logical Volume Manager (LVM):
- name: Extend an existing LVM
  hosts: <host group>
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Extend the physical volume
      command: pvresize /dev/<disk>

    - name: Extend the volume group
      command: vgextend <volume group> /dev/<disk>

    - name: Extend the logical volume
      command: lvextend -L +<size> /dev/<volume group>/<logical volume>

    - name: Resize the file system
      command: resize2fs /dev/<volume group>/<logical volume>

    - name: Show LVM information
      command: lvs
      register: result

    - name: Display LVM information
      debug:
        var: result.stdout_lines

#Where:
#<host group> is the group of hosts you want to run the playbook on.
