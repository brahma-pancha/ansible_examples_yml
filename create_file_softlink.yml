#Here's an example of an Ansible playbook that creates a file and a symbolic link:
---
- name: Create file and symbolic link using Ansible
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  gather_facts: no
  tasks:
  - name: Create a file
    copy:
      content: "This is a sample file."
      dest: /tmp/sample_file.txt

  - name: Create a symbolic link
    file:
      src: /tmp/sample_file.txt
      dest: /tmp/sample_link
      state: link
      force: yes

  - name: Verify if the symbolic link was created
    command: ls -l /tmp/sample_link
    register: link_result

  - name: Display the symbolic link information
    debug:
      var: link_result.stdout_lines

    #This playbook will:
    #Create a file with the specified content in /tmp/sample_file.txt using the copy module
    #Create a symbolic link /tmp/sample_link pointing to /tmp/sample_file.txt using the file module
    #Verify if the symbolic link was created successfully using the ls command and store the result in the link_result variable
    #Display the output of the ls command in a readable format using the debug module.

    #Note: Replace the values of content, dest, and src with your desired values.
