#Here's how you can create an encrypted file using the Ansible Vault command-line tool:

#   Open a terminal or command prompt.

#    Change to the directory where you want to create the encrypted file.

#    Run the following command:

$ ansible-vault create filename.yml

#Replace "filename.yml" with the name of the encrypted file you want to create.

#    You will be prompted to enter a password to encrypt the file. Enter a password and confirm it.

    #    The Ansible Vault will open an editor for you to enter the data you want to encrypt. Enter the data and save it.

    #    You can now run playbooks that reference the encrypted file. When running a playbook, you'll be prompted for the password to decrypt the data.

    #    To edit an encrypted file, run the following command:

$ ansible-vault edit filename.yml
