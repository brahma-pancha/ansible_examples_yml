#Here's an example of an Ansible playbook that creates a user and adds a supplementary group:

---
- name: Create user and add supplementary group using Ansible
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  gather_facts: no
  tasks:
  - name: Create the user
    user:
      name: new_user
      state: present
      groups: wheel

  - name: Add supplementary group
    user:
      name: new_user
      groups: supplementary_group
      append: yes

  - name: Verify the groups of the user
    command: id new_user
    register: user_result

  - name: Display the groups of the user
    debug:
      var: user_result.stdout_lines

    #This playbook will:
    #Create a new user new_user and add it to the wheel group using the user module
    #Add the new_user to a supplementary group supplementary_group using the user module with the append option set to yes
    #Verify the groups the user belongs to using the id command and store the result in the user_result variable
    #Display the output of the id command in a readable format using the debug module.

    #Note: Replace the values of name, groups, and supplementary_group with your desired values.
